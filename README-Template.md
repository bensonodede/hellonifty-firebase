# Hello Nifty

Its pretty difficult to ship your stuff around Kenya {emoji} in a way that is simple, reliable and affordable. Nifty is a tool built for this purpose while leveraging already existing platforms.
It runs on whatsapp! üôä

## Getting Started

Any third-party whatsapp API can be used for this project. The API should provide:

- Realtime reads for incoming messages.üëì
- Realtime writes to any number.‚úçüèæ
- Parsing for location objects sent through chat.üìç

Optional:

- Parsing for contact objects sent through chat.üì±

Pssst! Whatsapp third-party APIs are not officially supported by Whatsapp inc. which is why I have not provided links here.
